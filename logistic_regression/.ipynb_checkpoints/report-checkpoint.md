  <center> # Report for the homework-1: Logistic Regression </center>
  
  ## Introduction
     I finished the homework-1 of handwritten digit recognition using the Logistic Regression Model by Pytorch framework and the Jupyter-notebook IDE.
     By this experiment, I found that the model can be fitted from 1 epoch training of the network which id built. All the training and testing results can be found in the jupyter cached environment.
